### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a software engineer and recovering lawyer.  After spending a few years practicing law, I realized I was drawn to those parts of my job where I was working with technology and data.  So I left the law and I started my journey into software development. My primary stack is HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, although I'm always open to learning new technologies.  I'm currently working on a series of CSS Art projects where I try to recreate some of my favorite artwork using only CSS.  I'm also building a secondary/post-secondary ed application with React and Redux called classpoint. It will be a one-stop repository for course listings, class scheduling, and grades.  

I try to blog fairly often about my projects and you can find those [here--linktomedium]. 

You can find demos and hosted versions of my projects on my website at [curtisarnold.com].  

And finally, feel free to drop me a line on LinkeIn [linktolinkein].
