I'm a software engineer and recovering lawyer coding in HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. I'm currently working on a series of CSS Art projects where I try to recreate some of my favorite artwork using only CSS.  I'm also planning to build a few business applications-- (1) a document review and tagging application based on a MERN platform, making use of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, (2) a task management application built with React plus a Rails API, and (3) an application aimed at auditing open source software for third-party licenses, incorporating Python and SQL.  

I try to blog fairly often about my projects and you can find those here: https://arnold-curtis.medium.com/
